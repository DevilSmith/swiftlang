# SwiftLang

Multi-platform localization module on pure "Swift".

This small module allows you to embed a centralized localization system into your multi-platform applications. Provides "SLLocalizedObject" to get a set of translated words, as well as "SLLocalizingService" needed to deserialize dictionaries stored in the JSON file and handle requests from "SLLocalizedObject".
